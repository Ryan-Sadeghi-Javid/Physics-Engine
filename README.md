## 💡 2. **Record a Demo Video**
Record a **1–2 minute gameplay walkthrough**. Tools:
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) – Free and professional
- Upload to YouTube or Loom, then link it in your README

Focus on:
- Launching the game
- Showing levels and physics
- Explaining one cool technical aspect (e.g., how collisions work)

---

## 📁 3. **Organize Your Repo**
- Ensure `Sprites/`, `Sounds/`, and `LevelX/` folders are in their expected paths
- Create a `demo/` folder with prebuilt `.jar` and required assets for easy testing
- Add a `.gitignore` to exclude `out/` or IDE-specific files like `.idea/`

---

## 🧪 4. **Make the JAR Portable**
Sometimes assets aren’t bundled with `.jar`. To fix this:
- Use **relative paths** in your code
- Test your JAR on a clean system (like a virtual machine or another user account)
- Optionally, create a `build.sh` or `build.bat` script

---

## 🕹️ 5. **Optional Enhancements**
- **Add keyboard shortcuts list** in-game or in README
- **Add a GUI main menu** (even simple buttons using JavaFX or Swing)
- Include a **scoring system** or **game-over screen**
- Integrate a **level editor** (even basic)

---

## 🌐 6. **Host it as a Web App** (stretch goal)
If you want wider reach:
- Consider porting it to a browser using libGDX or TeaVM (Java to JavaScript)
- Or record the video demo + GitHub as your portfolio entry

Would you like me to help create a polished `README.md` for you based on the current project?
